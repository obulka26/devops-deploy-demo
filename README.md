# Infrastructure + Python App Project

## Description

This project combines a Python application with infrastructure automation. It uses:

- **Terraform** for provisioning infrastructure,
- **Ansible** for configuration management and deployment,
- **Docker** for containerizing the application,
- **Python** for application logic and testing.

The application is organized for clean deployment, automated setup, and includes a basic test suite.
